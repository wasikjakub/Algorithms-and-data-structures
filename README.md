# Algorithms and data structures
Object-oriented approach to chosen alorithms/data structures written in pure python
## Outputs and explanitions
### Ford-Fulkerson
First value on the lest side of '-----' is graph capacity  
  
then information about every edge is display (capacity, flow, residual, is residual?)  

EXAMPLE: edge from s to v has capacity = 2, flow = 2, residual = 0, is not residual
